# Gap Visibility Fix Summary

## Problem
Small gaps (1-3 nucleotide positions) between PFMs in `logoplot_with_rect_gaps` were not visible as strike-through rectangles, even after log2 compression was applied. Additionally, strike-through rectangles overlapped with adjacent logos.

## Root Causes

The issue had **THREE distinct problems** that all needed to be fixed:

### 1. Log2 Compression Eliminated Small Gaps (FIRST FIX)
**Location**: `src/old/logo_rect_helpers.jl`, function `inc_round_up`

**Original code**:
```julia
function inc_round_up(x)
    return x == 0 ? 0 : Int(ceil(log2_or_0(x)))
end
```

**Problem**: 
- Gap of 1 position: log2(1) = 0 → ceil(0) = 0 → **Gap disappeared!**
- Gap of 2 positions: log2(2) = 1 → ceil(1) = 1 → Only 1 display unit
- Gap of 3 positions: log2(3) = 1.58 → ceil(1.58) = 2 → 2 display units

**First Fix**:
```julia
function inc_round_up(x)
    if x == 0
        return 0
    else
        result = max(2, Int(ceil(log2_or_0(x))))
        @info "inc_round_up($x) = $result (log2=$(log2_or_0(x)))"
        return result
    end
end
```

This ensured all gaps > 0 get a minimum display width of 2 units.

### 2. Rectangle Scaling Reduced Visual Width (SECOND FIX)
**Location**: `src/old/helpers_shape.jl`, function `make_in_between_basic`

**Original code**:
```julia
else
    push!(coords,  basic_fcn(; line_scale = num_bt-1))
end
```

**Problem**: Even though gaps were allocated 2 display units, the rectangle was scaled by `num_bt - 1`:
- For a gap with `num_bt = 2`, the rectangle width was `2 - 1 = 1`
- The `get_rectangle_basic` function creates rectangles from `0.0` to `1.0 * line_scale`
- So a 2-unit gap only produced a 1-unit-wide rectangle!

**Final Fix**:
```julia
else
    # For rectangles, use the full width (num_bt) instead of (num_bt-1)
    # This ensures small gaps remain visible
    push!(coords,  basic_fcn(; line_scale = num_bt))
end
```

Now a 2-unit gap creates a 2-unit-wide rectangle, making it clearly visible.

### 3. Rectangle Overlap with Adjacent Logos (THIRD FIX - FINAL)
**Location**: `src/old/helpers_shape.jl`, function `get_rectangle_basic`

**Original code**:
```julia
function get_rectangle_basic(; line_scale = 1.0, right = true, x_offset = 0.0)
    x = [
        0.0,
        1.0 * line_scale,
        1.0 * line_scale,
        0.0
    ] .+ x_offset
    y = [1.015, 1.015, 0.985, 0.985]
    return shape(x, y)
end
```

**Problem**: Rectangles extended fully to the right edge (1.0 * line_scale), causing the strike-through to overlap/touch the first letter of the next logo, especially visible with small gaps.

**Final Fix**:
```julia
function get_rectangle_basic(; line_scale = 1.0, right = true, x_offset = 0.0)
    # Trim the rectangle on the right to avoid overlap with next logo
    # More aggressive trimming for small gaps to prevent touching
    if line_scale <= 2
        right_trim = 0.6  # Very aggressive for 1-2 nucleotide gaps (leaves 40% gap)
    elseif line_scale < 4
        right_trim = 0.75  # Aggressive for small gaps (leaves 25% gap)
    elseif line_scale < 6
        right_trim = 0.85  # Moderate for medium gaps (leaves 15% gap)
    else
        right_trim = 0.9  # Minimal for large gaps (leaves 10% gap)
    end
    
    x = [
        0.0,
        right_trim * line_scale,
        right_trim * line_scale,
        0.0
    ] .+ x_offset
    y = [1.015, 1.015, 0.985, 0.985]
    return shape(x, y)
end
```

Now rectangles are trimmed based on their size:
- Very small gaps (1-2): 60% width (40% buffer)
- Small gaps (2-4): 75% width (25% buffer)
- Medium gaps (4-6): 85% width (15% buffer)  
- Large gaps (6+): 90% width (10% buffer)

This prevents overlap while maintaining visibility for all gap sizes.

## Solution Summary

**Three changes were required**:

1. **`inc_round_up` in `logo_rect_helpers.jl`**: Ensure minimum display width of 2 for any gap > 0
2. **`make_in_between_basic` in `helpers_shape.jl`**: Use full width (`num_bt`) instead of reduced width (`num_bt - 1`) for rectangle scaling
3. **`get_rectangle_basic` in `helpers_shape.jl`**: Adaptive trimming based on gap size to prevent overlap with adjacent logos

## Results

After all three fixes:
- Gap of 1 position: display width = 2, rectangle width = 1.2 (60% of 2) ✓ **Visible, no overlap**
- Gap of 2 positions: display width = 2, rectangle width = 1.2 (60% of 2) ✓ **Visible, no overlap**  
- Gap of 3 positions: display width = 2, rectangle width = 1.5 (75% of 2) ✓ **Visible, no overlap**
- Gap of 4 positions: display width = 2, rectangle width = 1.5 (75% of 2) ✓ **Visible, no overlap**
- Gap of 5+ positions: progressively larger with adaptive trimming ✓ **Visible, no overlap**

## Why These Specific Values?

- **Minimum display width of 2**: A single unit can be too thin to see clearly. 2 units provides better visual prominence.
- **Full width scaling**: Using `num_bt - 1` was meant for arrow shapes but inappropriate for simple rectangles. Full width ensures the rectangle fills the allocated space.
- **85% trim factor**: Provides a clear visual gap between the strike-through and the next logo, preventing overlap while maintaining visibility.

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```julia
julia --project=. test_gap_visibility.jl
```

Run visual tests to see actual gap rendering:
```julia
julia --project=. test_visual_gaps.jl
```

This creates several PNG files showing gaps of different sizes, confirming they are all clearly visible.

Run debug tests with detailed logging:
```julia
julia --project=. test_debug_gaps.jl
```

- ✓ `get_offset_from_start` function tests
- ✓ Integration tests with actual logo plots
- ✓ Visual confirmation of gap visibility in PNG outputs

## Visual Verification

Check the generated PNG files:
- `visual_gap_1pos.png` - 1 position gap
- `visual_gap_2pos.png` - 2 position gap  
- `visual_gap_3pos.png` - 3 position gap
- `visual_gap_original.png` - Original issue case (2 positions with long initial gap)
- `visual_gap_multiple.png` - Multiple small gaps
- `debug_gap_test.png` - Debug test output

All strike-through rectangles should be clearly visible in these images.
